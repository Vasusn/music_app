## Music Player App in Flutter

## Introduction

This GitHub project aims to develop a music player app using Flutter that allows users to play audio files from their local storage. The app will provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to browse and play their favorite music tracks directly from their device.

## Features

The music player app will have the following features:

1. **Audio Player**: Users can play audio files in various formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, AAC) stored locally on their device.

2. **Browse Local Storage**: The app will have access to the device's local storage to search and retrieve audio files.

3. **Play Controls**: Basic play controls such as play, pause, stop, previous, and next track will be available.

4. **Progress Bar**: A progress bar will show the current track's playback progress, and users can seek to a specific position in the track.


## Technology Stack

The music player app will be built using the following technologies:

- **Flutter**: The UI framework for building the cross-platform app (Android and iOS).

- **Dart**: The programming language used with Flutter for app development.

- **audioplayers Plugin**: A Flutter plugin to handle audio playback.

- **path_provider Plugin**: A Flutter plugin to access the device's local storage.

## Installation and Usage

To use the music player app, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.

2. Install Flutter and set up your development environment (if you haven't already).

3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Android Studio, Visual Studio Code).

4. Run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies.

5. Connect your Android or iOS device to your development machine or use an emulator.

6. Run the app using `flutter run` command.

7. Grant necessary permissions for accessing local storage on your device.
